Estimates animal density and related parameters from mark-recapture line transect surveys on which recaptures are not 
identified there is animal movement and animals' availability is governed by a Markov model. Current version ignores 
forward distances, assumes all detected animals are at zero forward distance when detected (as is the case for high-
definition video survey, for example).
